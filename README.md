## What is an NBA shotchart?

A shotchart is a type of visualization that allows coaches and players to assess strong
and weak points of a player's shot selection. These charts give coaches an idea
of how effective a player's offensive capabilities in certain areas on the court.
With a little bit of frequency analytics, coaches can devise plays based on where players are making the most shots, which can allow players to be more effectively utilized in a game.
